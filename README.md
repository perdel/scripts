# Scripts

Here I collect various scripts that are somewhat useful.

- `backup.sh`: Rsync-based backup script. Supports linked incremental backups.
- `batstat.py`: Python script that queries the battery status at regular intervals. Sends notifications if status is critical or battery is full.
- `power-statistics.py`: Track and analyze battery energy consumption.
- `julia.py`: Plot Julia sets.
- `color_demo.vim`: Generate available terminal colors in vim.
